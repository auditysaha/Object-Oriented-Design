/**
 * We have an interface TransactionMethod representing a method for performing transactions.
 * The DepositTransaction and WithdrawalTransaction classes implement the TransactionMethod
 * interface to represent deposit and withdrawal transaction methods, respectively.
 * The BankingSystem class represents a banking system that can perform transactions
 * using different methods. It depends on the abstraction provided by the TransactionMethod
 * interface, allowing it to use any transaction method without being coupled to specific implementations.
 * The DependencyInversionPrincipleDemo class demonstrates the usage of the banking system
 * with different transaction methods. It creates instances of DepositTransaction and WithdrawalTransaction
 * and configures the banking system with them, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle
 * by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
